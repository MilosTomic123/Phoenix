Dark Souls is a game that changed the gaming industry. Because of the enormous popularity of that game, today we have a genre called "souls genre". 
The souls genre defines all games that implement the things which define dark souls. They are the following: tough difficulty, respawning enemies and 
losing your experience on stop spot on which you died. These three things have been a implemented in many different games after the initial dark souls
release back in 2011. It was no surprise that many gamers fell immediately in love with the souls genre. The satisfaction they provied is unmatched in
the gaming industry. The pure joy after you beat a boss that killed you countless times is something that you can't even describe. E.g., my hardest 
fight took place in Bloodborne. A playstation 4 exclusive. To be more precise, it took place in the dlc for that game which release much later. The 
first boss of the dlc was just insane... That insance maniac was so hard to bring down that I had to (re)farm all my hp potions several times. In other
words, I had to fight other tough enemies just to get back at fighting that maniac of a boss. After finally beating him I just felt amazing.
